# Design Reviews

Design reviews are an essential part of every software development project.

At it's core a design review is simply demonstrating the work done so far and
collecting feedback for future development.


## Scorecard

The most efficient way to gather feedback it to create a scorecard that has
the design requirements and have the reviewer fill it out.
