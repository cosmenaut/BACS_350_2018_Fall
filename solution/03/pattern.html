<p>
    The Page Design Pattern allows you to write code once and use it many times.
</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
    Many constructs are repeated on different pages of a website. We need an easy way to use code that we have written
    for several different pages. HTML provides no mechanism that will allow us to reuse HTML code.
</p>
<p>
    One place where this would be handy is in defining a standard HTML structure for every web page in our
    site. All of the code required to start a page and the code to end a page could be packaged in a way
    that we would not have to replicate this code.
</p>

<p>This is a simple HTML page that demonstrates using an Include to capture boiler-plate code.</p>
<p>This reduces duplication in code.</p>
<p>In this demo the <b>$page_title</b> is set as a variable that is used by the <b>header.php</b> file.</p>
<p>This page also includes a stylesheet.</p>


<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>
    Define a standard header and footer that should be on every HTML page. Then build this into two functions
    that can be invoked to import the header and footer code.
</p>
<p>
    Define a page with the following PHP code.
</p>
<pre>
        // Start Page
        require_once 'views.php';
        $page_title = 'Page Title';
        begin_page($page_title);
        
        // Add PHP content here 
        
        // End Page
        end_page();
</pre>

<p>
    Other files can be included to build a page.  Example:  <a href="pattern.html">pattern.html</a>.
